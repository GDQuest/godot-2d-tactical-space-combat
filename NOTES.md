# General

- `NavigationPolygonInstance` there seems to be [a bug](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/38204#issuecomment-678620211) with `NavigationPolygonInstance` when making polygons from outlines

# FTL

- Grid movement with large grids
- Grid spreading fire **not fun**

# Tips

- To duplicate root node in a scene use _Right Click > Merge From Scene_
- Use white sprite to tint it for fast coloring
- Positive rotation turns right
- Connect signals with default binds (true/false eg.)
